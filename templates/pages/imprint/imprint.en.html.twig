    <p>We use the above data to organise the participation of the person registering
    for the event and to carry out the event. The legal basis for the processing of
    this personal data is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO. We store this data for
    the above-mentioned purposes until the event is held.
    </p>

    <p>We then store the data for an additional period of three years. This storage is
    based on our legitimate interest in being able to defend ourselves against any
    legal claims that may arise from the event or to assert such claims. The legal
    basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DS-GMO.
    </p>

    <p>The data collected during registration will be processed internally by the
    department responsible for organising the event. In addition, the data can be
    passed on to external recipients. These include above all service providers who
    support us in the organisation and execution of the event. In addition to our
    general service providers listed below, we also use additional service providers
    for online voting in connection with the event and its organisation in addition
    to the general service providers listed below. Some events are supported by the
    Wikimedia Foundation. If this is the case, we transmit data for reporting
    purposes.
    </p>

    <p>If, at your request, we provide additional services for you, such as travel or
    hotel bookings or the organisation of child care, we transmit the data to the
    recipients required for the respective service provision. These can be in
    particular: Hotels, travel agencies, the Federal Foreign Office, other
    authorities of foreign countries for issuing visas. Depending on your place of
    residence and the event location, these recipients may also be located in third
    countries outside the EU or the EEA for which no adequacy resolution of the EU
    Commission exists. In such cases, however, we will only make transfers which are
    necessary either for the performance of the contract between you and us or for
    the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between
    us and the recipient.
    </p>

    <p>Photos and videos are created at our events, which in certain cases we publish
    on our social media channels. However, this only takes place with your consent,
    which we will ask you for separately.

     YouTube
    </h3>

    <p>We use videos from YouTube and YouTube plug-ins on our website. YouTube is a
    service provided by YouTube LLC ("YouTube"), 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA
    94066, USA. YouTube LLC is a subsidiary of Google LLC ("Google"), 1600
    Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

    <p>YouTube is integrated by embedding the service on our website using an
    "iFrame". When loading this iFrame, YouTube or Google may collect and process
    information (including personal data). It cannot be ruled out that YouTube or
    Google may also transfer the information to a server in a third country. Google
    and its subsidiaries are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield to ensure an
    adequate level of protection during processing. For more information, please
    visit https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/frameworks/.</p>

    <p>We ourselves cannot influence which data YouTube actually collects and
    processes. However, YouTube states that the following information (including
    personal data) may in principle be processed: Protocol data (in particular the
    IP address), location-related information, unique application numbers. In
    addition, the plug-in can use cookies and similar technologies.</p>

    <p>If you are signed in to your Google Account, Google may add the processed
    information to your account and treat it as personal information, depending on
    your account settings, see in particular
    https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/partners. You can prevent this
    information from being added directly by logging out of your Google Account
    before you open a page, or by making the appropriate account settings in your
    Google Account.</p>

    <p>The integration of YouTube enables us to present you various videos on our
    website so that you can watch them directly on our website. The legal basis for
    the processing of personal data described here is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
    Our legitimate interest in this lies in the great benefit that YouTube offers.
    By integrating external videos we relieve our servers and can use corresponding
    resources for other purposes. Among other things, this can increase the
    stability of our servers. YouTube or Google also has a legitimate interest in
    the (personal) data collected in order to improve its own services.</p>

    <p>For more information, please see YouTube's and Google's privacy policy, which
    you can access here: <a
    href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>

    <p>Within Wikimedia, the departments responsible for processing your request
    have access to your data. In addition, we use external service providers where
    we are unable to perform services ourselves or where it makes no sense to do so.
    These external service providers are primarily providers of IT services and
    telecommunications services. As far as the legal requirements are met, we have
    concluded order processing contracts with these service providers.</p>


    <p>A transfer to third countries does not take place in principle. However, we
    use the G Suite service of Google LLC ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
    Mountain View, CA 94043, USA for our workflows. Google LLC is certified under
    the EU-US Privacy Shield to ensure an adequate level of privacy.</p>
