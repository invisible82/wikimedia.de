    <p>
        Personal data is collected on this website only to the technically necessary extent. In no case will
        the data collected be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties. Below you will find an overview
        of the data collected by us within the framework of this website.<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Log-Files: When using this offer, the data transmitted by your browser to the server will be
            recorded and saved. This usually includes information about the type and version of the browser
            you are using, the operating system you are using, the referrer URL (the web page from which you
            came to this web site), the host name of the accessing computer (the IP address), and the time
            of the server request. As a rule, these data can not be assigned to specific persons - and thus
            not to you. Neither does it reconcile data with other data for this purpose, nor does it merge
            it with other data. The data are regularly deleted after a statistical evaluation.<br></li>
        <li>Cookies: This website uses cookies in several places. Cookies are small text files that your
            browser stores and which serve to make the use of a website easier, more effective and safer.
            Cookies do not harm your computer, take up minimal space and do not contain viruses.<br></li>
        <li>Google Analytics: This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google
            Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your
            computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated
            by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the
            USA and stored there. However, in the event of activation of IP anonymisation on this website,
            your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European
            Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in
            exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened
            there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate
            your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services
            related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address provided
            by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. You
            can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software; however,
            please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to
            the fullest extent possible. In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data
            generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as
            well as the processing of this data by Google by using the link below (<a

            to download and install the available browser plugin. You can prevent the collection by Google
            Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent future
